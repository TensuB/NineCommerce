        <p>I'm Barry, creator of <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;"> The Plant-Based BluePrint</span>, the first comprehensive and definitive guide into plant-based eating, nutrition and lifestyle. </p>
        <p>I have studied plant-based nutrition for over 10 years. I have read every book, learned from everyone I can, travelled the world to learn eating habits and mind-sets.  </p>
        <p>As much as changing to plant-based eating is understanding nutrition and how to do it, it is mostly about overcoming our misunderstandings, breaking our lifelong food addictions, and more.  </p>

                                        <p>I wasn't raised eating only plants. Like most kids, I was raised on the standard western diet of meat and dairy products, highly processed and artificially sweetened foods, with minimal contribution of fruits, vegetables, pulses and whole grains. From the first tastes of meat, chocolate and cheese, our minds are set, our beliefs are concrete - we are now brainwashed and addicted. </p>

                                        <p>Sometime in my mid-teens, when I began studying all things health and fitness related, I realised the importance of nutrition in my physical training, so I began eating a 'healthy' omnivorous diet, one of 'lean' white meat, tuna fish, skimmed cow's milk and egg whites, with plenty of fruit and vegetables, of course. I felt very healthy.</p>

                                        <p>Looking back, I wasn't <strong>truly</strong> healthy, I was just young.</p>

                                <p>My journey to plant-based began by reading Dan Buettner's 2008 book, The Blue Zones, which catalogues his exploration of the longest living peoples on our planet. A true inspiration – I read this book in springtime, accompanied with bread, olives and a glass of <em>Cannonau di Sardegna</em>.</p>
                                <p>Introduced to the concept of plant-based, Dan's book was followed by studying the work of Ancel Keys and his Seven Countries Study (the original study of the Mediterranean diet), T.C. Campbell and his China Study, as well as the Willcox's study of the Okinawan centenarians. The pattern was obvious; those living the longest and healthiest lives followed a whole-food, plant-based diet.</p>

                                <p>Once I discovered that the healthiest diet for humans was whole food plant-based, that we don’t need meat for growth and muscle strength, and that animal-based food is actually detrimental to long-term health, I never ate meat again. An overnight decision - this was actually the easiest change I made.</p>
                                <p>Dairy and eggs were more of an issue. These nasty foods are everywhere – dairy milk in chocolate, cheese on pizzas, eggs in all things baked – I couldn’t escape them! Furthermore, trying my best to avoid them - I just didn’t realise how dependent on these foods I was. I had more learning to do – and some lifelong food addictions to extinguish.</p>

                                <p>Transitioning from vegetarian to exclusively plant-based was the most challenging yet educational and inspiring two years of my journey. Learning to bake without eggs, realising dark chocolate is superior to milk chocolate, and that cheese and butter is simply not for human consumption. I replaced and ultimately removed these foods from my diet and my mind completely.</p>
                                <p>Over the last several years, I have been fully immersed in the plant-based lifestyle. Travelling the world to learn recipes and mindsets, a real journey of discovery. How do you eat plant-based in the meat-eating city of Cali, Colombia? How do you enjoy?</p>

There’s something about voluntary solitude and writing. This habit repeated itself in further trips, Blue Mountains in Jamaica, Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica and Cameron Highlands in Malaysia to name a few.</p>
                                <p>Over the last several years, I have spent countless hours answering the questions and queries of my nearest and dearest, and being told over and over – write your book! So I started flirting with my ideas in 2016, crystallising my concepts, and putting pen to paper. The seeds of the Blueprint.</p>

             <p>I began my training in clinical chemistry in 2006, receiving my Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists in 2013. I currently work for the NHS as a state-registered Clinical Scientist in Biochemistry. </p>
